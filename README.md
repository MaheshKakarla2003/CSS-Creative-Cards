Short description

Two card UI examples that showcase hover animations and layering effects:
- Card 1: a sliding background color reveal with text and CTA.
- Card 2: layered card with image reveal and rotated pseudo-element backgrounds on hover.

What it demonstrates
- CSS transitions and transform
- pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for layered effects
- positioning (`position: absolute/relative`)
- overflow and object-fit for images
- hover-triggered animations and color changes
- simple responsive sizing using width/height
